## Hi I'm Tevin

### Why
I am an aspiring software developer motivated by an unwavering appetite for learning. I enter the fast-paced world of technology excited about the possibilities of crafting innovative solutions that have a tangible impact. I thoroughly enjoy coding on a personal level and fantasize about developing applications that solve day-to-day problems and change peopleâ€™s lives. I look forward to gaining new skills at your organization working with passionate coaches and mentors where I can learn and grow.

### How
While I may be fresh to the field, I've armed myself with a solid foundation in computer science principles and dipped my toes into a few programming languages.

I have a knack for breaking down complex problems into manageable chunks, allowing me to approach solving problems with a critical mindset which is a necessary trait to have as a developer.

### What
My ultimate goal is to become a well-rounded software developer, capable of crafting end-to-end applications that seamlessly integrate frontend and backend components. I want to create user interfaces that are not only visually stunning but also intuitive and responsive. And on the backend, I'm eager to build robust and secure systems that power these applications.

This opportunity will give me guidance as I work toward that direction and receive valuable mentorship and coaching from the coaches in the program. I look forward to your response.
